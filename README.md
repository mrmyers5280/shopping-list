# shopping-list
A web page with a jQuery enabled shopping list for the Front End Web Developer course by <a href="http://www.thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>.

The list should have checkboxes for when things are completed. When checked, the text of the list item should be displayed in strikethrough.

The list should be reorderable by clicking and dragging.

The list will appear to be on ruled paper.
